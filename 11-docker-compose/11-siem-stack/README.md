## Latest Build News

- Implemented Impossible Distance Alert. Currently set to 1200km at 6hr.
- Modified many of the configurations to support logging in via LDAP.
- Authentication to the ES Stack / Kibana is now LDAP driven. There is a LDAP group `ESAdminGroup` that is in the example.com Root DSE. Adding a user to this group now gives them access to kibana and all data within elasticsearch as an admin.
- Migrated all indexes to using ILM. This means by default the stack will only store 2 days worth of logs and ensure indexes do not grow over 2GB. This is done because the enviroment is setup as a demo. HEAP sizes in the ES server are SMALL becasue this is a demo. I will soon have production ready documents written to show customers how this can be brought to production.
- Tested updating to elastic 7.6.1 (all good)
- Added in Slack Alerting!
  - The process requires running a script after you start your stack.
  - The script will ask you for your webhook url, then add the configuration into the elasticsearch keystore.
  - To run the script run the config_slack_alerts.sh script from the project directory end enter in your webhook URL.
