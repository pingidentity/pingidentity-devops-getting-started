# If left empty, PingFederate will do a name lookup to find its name.
pf.admin.hostname=

#
# This property defines the IP address over which the PingFederate
# administrative console communicates. Use for deployments where multiple
# network interfaces are installed on the machine running PingFederate.

# Runtime Server Properties
# -------------------------
#
# To turn off an HTTP listener, set the port to a value of less than zero.
# You should always use SSL. Turning on "pf.http.port" is not recommended.
# If you do want to turn on "pf.http.port" for testing purposes, you will
# need to update data/config-store/session-cookie-config.xml
# to turn off the secure cookie.
pf.http.port=-1

#
# This property defines the port on which PingFederate listens for
# encrypted HTTPS (SSL/TLS) traffic.
# Default is 9031.
pf.https.port=9031

#
# This property defines a secondary HTTPS port that can be used, for example,
# with SOAP or artifact SAML bindings or for WS-Trust STS calls.
# To use this port, change the placeholder value to the port number
# you want to use.
# Important: If you are using mutual SSL/TLS for either WS-Trust STS
# authentication or for SAML back-channel authentication, you must use this
# port for security reasons (or use a similarly configured new listener,
# with either "WantClientAuth" or "NeedClientAuth" set to "true".
pf.secondary.https.port=-1

#
# This property defines the IP address over which the PingFederate server
# communicates with partner federation gateways. Use for deployments where
# multiple network interfaces are installed on the machine running PingFederate.

# for "0.0.0.0".
pf.engine.bind.address=0.0.0.0

#
# This property defines the IP address over which an SNMP agent and JMX
# communicate with PingFederate. Use for deployments where multiple network
# interfaces are installed on the machine running PingFederate.
# The bind addresses can be ipv6 compliant: use "::" as a replacement
# for "0.0.0.0".
pf.monitor.bind.address=0.0.0.0

#
# This property defines the protocol to be used by PingFederate.
# Valid values are:
#   true  - Enables use of ipv_4 only.
#   false - Enables use of both ipv_4 and ipv_6.
# Default is true.
pf.engine.prefer_ipv4=true

# This property defines the context path used for the PingFederate runtime

# Deployment Properties
# ---------------------

#   Operational Mode
#   ----------------
# This property indicates the operational mode of the runtime server (protocol
# engine) from a clustering standpoint.
#   Valid values are:
#     STANDALONE        - This server is a standalone instance that runs both
#                       the UI console and protocol engine (default).
#     CLUSTERED_CONSOLE - This server is part of a cluster and runs only the
#                       administration console.
#     CLUSTERED_ENGINE  - This server is part of a cluster and runs only the
#                       protocol engine.
# Note: Only one node in a cluster can run the administrative console.
# Default is STANDALONE.
pf.operational.mode=$OPERATIONAL_MODE

# The following properties apply only if "pf.operational.mode"
# is *not* STANDALONE:
pf.cluster.node.index=
# A strong, randomly-generated key (22 or more alphanumerics) is recommended.
pf.cluster.auth.pwd=
pf.cluster.encrypt=false

# Specify the key size to use with the AES encryption algorithm that is used
# when encrypting communication among the cluster. The key sizes allowed
# are dependent on the cryptography provider enabled with the JVM.  For
# example, Oracle's Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength
# provider supports 128, 192, and 256 bit key sizes.
# Default is 128.
pf.cluster.encryption.keysize=128

# Specify the IP address for cluster communication, or leave as NON_LOOPBACK to
# allow the system to choose an available non-loopback IP address.
pf.cluster.bind.address=$CLUSTER_BIND_ADDRESS
pf.cluster.bind.port=7600
pf.cluster.failure.detection.bind.port=7700

# Allowed values for the following properties are: tcp/udp. Default is tcp.
# IMPORTANT: For UDP clustering with PingFederate running on Windows using ipv6.
# You must supply the interface identifier (for example: %11) in the
# "pf.cluster.bind.address" above.
pf.cluster.transport.protocol=tcp
pf.cluster.mcast.group.address=239.16.96.69
pf.cluster.mcast.group.port=7601

# When TCP is used, this property specifies a list of initial hosts to be
# contacted for a group discovery, for example,
# "10.0.1.4[7600],server2.mydomain.com[7600]".
#
# IMPORTANT: For ipv6, DO NOT use brackets ([]) to surround the IP addresses.
#
# For dynamic clusters using tcp as the transport protocol, alternate
# discovery mechanisms are available. See server/default/conf/tcp.xml for
# further details. If a dynamic discovery mechanism is used, this property
# is ignored.
pf.cluster.tcp.discovery.initial.hosts=$DISCOVERY_INITIAL_HOST

# This property enables/disables adaptive clustering. Please see the
# PingFederate clustering guide for more information on this capability.
#  Valid values are:
#   true - enable adaptive clustering
#   false - disable adaptive clustering
# Default is true.
pf.cluster.adaptive=true

# This property enables/disables JGroups cluster diagnostics.
#  Valid values are:
#	true - enable diagnostics
#	false - disable diagnostics
# Default is false
pf.cluster.diagnostics.enabled=false

# These properties define the IP address and port over which PingFederate communicates
# JGroups diagnostic information.

pf.hsm.mode=OFF

#  Hardware Security Module Hybrid Mode
#  ------------------------------------
#  This property enables or disables Hybrid mode for an HSM setup.
#
#  When PF is in Hybrid mode, certs/keys can be created either on the local trust store or on the HSM.
#  This can used as a migration strategy towards an HSM setup.
#
#  Valid values are:
#    true - enable Hybrid mode.
#    false - disable Hybrid mode.
# Default is false.
pf.hsm.hybrid=false

#   Outbound Provisioner Properties
#   ---------------------------
# This property enables or disables Outbound Provisioning.
# The default is disabled. This property also enables provisioning failover
# (Separate licensing is required to activate the provisioner.).
#
#   Valid values are:
#     STANDALONE - Turns the provisioner module on,
#                  standalone mode (no failover).
#     FAILOVER   - Turns the provisioner module on, failover mode.
#     OFF        - Turns the provisioner module off.
# Default is OFF.
# When only one server is in use, set the value to STANDALONE.
# When more than one server is in use and failover is desired,
# set the value to FAILOVER for each server.
pf.provisioner.mode=OFF

#
# In failover mode, each node must have a unique ID from 1 to n, where n is the
# number of nodes in the failover network. The lower the node ID, the higher the
# priority for that node (only one server can actively handle provisioning at
# one time). Set the initial active provisioning server node ID to 1.
provisioner.node.id=1

# Grace period, in seconds, after which a node is considered dead and failover
# occurs. This value should be larger than the provisioning-frequency cycle.
provisioner.failover.grace.period=600

#   Jetty Customization Properties
#   ---------------------------
# In order to be interoperable with a wide range of external systems PingFederate
# has been modified to handle special cases related to encoding cookies.
#
# When setting a cookie, PingFederate will first evaluate
# 'jetty51.encode.wildcard.session.cookies' and 'jetty51.encode.cookies' to see
# if the cookie values should be encoded.  If the cookie value should be encoded,
# PingFederate will then encode the following characters (space included): ;, "
#
# If it's been determined that the cookie shouldn't be encoded, PingFederate will
# then check for the existence of special characters.  If found, the cookie value
# will be wrapped in quotes.  The following is a list of characters that would
# trigger wrapping the value in quotes (space included): \n\r\t\f\b%+ ;="\
#
# If special characters are not detected or the cookie name is defined in
# 'cookies.skip.quoting' PingFederate will set the cookie value without wrapping
# or encoding it.
#
#
# When 'true', PingFederate will encode cookie values for all cookies with names
# that end with "SESSION" (e.g. SMSESSION).
jetty51.encode.wildcard.session.cookies=true

# A comma separated list of cookie names whose values PingFederate will encode
# when the cookie is set.
jetty51.encode.cookies=

# A comma separated list of cookie names whose values should *not* be wrapped
# in quotes when special characters are detected.
cookies.skip.quoting=_saml_idp

#   SSL Session Cache
#   -----------------
# Sets the size of the SSL session cache used for storing SSLSession objects.
# 0 means there is no limit.
javax.net.ssl.sessionCacheSize=5000

#   HTTP Forward Proxy Settings
#   ---------------------------
# Uncomment and set the following Java properties to have outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic sent through
# a forward proxy. Some hosts may also be flagged to bypass the proxy.
# Please consult the Oracle Java Networking Properties documentation for more information.
#http.proxyHost=<HTTP_PROXY_HOST>
#http.proxyPort=<HTTP_PROXY_PORT>
#https.proxyHost=<HTTPS_PROXY_HOST>
#https.proxyPort=<HTTPS_PROXY_PORT>
#http.nonProxyHosts=*.internal.com|localhost

# This property determines whether PingFederate omits line breaks in XML digital signatures. Default is true.
org.apache.xml.security.ignoreLineBreaks=true

# COMMENT THIS OUT IF TOO MUCH OUTPUT ON LDAP CHATTER
# com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.debug.enabled=true
# com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.debug.level=FINEST
# com.unboundid.ldap.sdk.debug.type=LDAP
