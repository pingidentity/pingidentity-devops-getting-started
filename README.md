# Ping Identity DevOps - Getting Started
Provides foundational examples to get familiar with the DevOps toolkit. In [this repository](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-devops-getting-started), we'll cover the basics of running PingFederate, PingDirectory, PingAccess, and more in Docker containers with various additonal container orchestration tools. 

## Documentation

## ldapsdk tool
Use the `ldapsdk` tool in the top level directory to startup an `ldap-sdk-tools` container
allowing for easy access to the LDAP SDK Tools (such as ldapsearch, ldapmodify, and other tools).

Running `ldapsdk` the first time will help configure your settings.  After that, you
simply run.  To edit the settings in the future, use the configure option:
`ldapsdk configure`.

## Bash profile Docker helper aliases
Several aliases are available in the utility `bash_profile_devops` to perform common 
Docker commands with containers, images, services, and so on.  You can easily source this
from your bash startup file (i.e. .bash_profile) to make easy use of these alias.

## Docker images

* A complete listing of Ping Identity's public images used in these examples is available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/pingidentity/)
