# Release Notes

## Devops Docker Builds, Version 2103 (March 2021)

### New Features

- **Images run as non-privileged user by default**

      _Critical:_ We've greatly improved the security of our images by having them run as a non-privileged user by default.  See [Migrating to Unprivileged Images](https://devops.pingidentity.com/how-to/migratingRootToUnprivileged/) for information about migrating existing deployments.

- **Layer simplification**

      We've consolidated layers in our images where possible.

### Enhancements

- **PingFederate**
      - The baseline image now uses data.json instead of the former use of the /data folder.
      - New variables have been added to run.properties for controlling provisioning failover and grace period.
      - Versions 10.1.5 and 10.3-Beta are now available.

- **PingAccess**
      - Versions 6.2.1 and 6.3-Beta are now available.

- **PingCentral**
      - Versions 1.7.0 is now available.

- **PingDirectory**
      - The number of layers present in the image has been reduced and simplified.
      - Version 8.2.0.3 is now available.

- **PingDataGovernance**
      - Version 8.2.0.3 is now available.

- **PingDataSync**
      - Version 8.2.0.3 is now available.
