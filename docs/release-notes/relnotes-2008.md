# Release Notes

## DevOps Docker Builds, Version 2008 (August 2020)

### New Features

- **Secret Management**

      A number of key enhancements have been made to natively support secret management within our Docker Images. See [Documentation](../how-to/usingVault.md) for implementation details.

- **DevOps Development Mode**

      We've added a 'Continue on Failure' option to all Docker Images. This allows the Container to say alive while any potential issues are being investigated.

- **DevOps Program Registration**

      Signing up for the Ping DevOps program is now self-service! Simply follow the instructions found [Here](../get-started/devopsRegistration.md).

### Improvements

- **Ping-DevOps Utility**

      We've added secret management commands to ping-devops, allowing you to quickly integrate secrets into your deployments.

- **Image Restart State**

      A number of enhancements have been made to improve the overall restart flow in our Docker Images.

### Resolved Defects
