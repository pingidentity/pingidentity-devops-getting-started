# Release Notes

## DevOps Docker Builds, Version 2006 (June 2020)

### New Features

- **Docker Compose Volumes**

      Applications that create and manage configuration now have mounted volumes in Docker-Compose [Examples](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-devops-getting-started/tree/master/11-docker-compose/), ensuring that your configuration changes are persisted across restarted.

- **PingAccess Image Enhancements**

      We've updated the PingAccess Image to support the new features available in version 6.1.

- **Customer Support Data Collection**

      Included in this release is the Java diagnostic tool to enable embedded customer support data collection. This tool set includes [jstat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/share/jstat.html), [jmap](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/share/jmap.html) and [jhat](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/share/jhat.html).

- **Docker Build Pipeline**
      - We've published [Documentation](../reference/buildLocal.md) on how to build a Ping Identity Docker Image using a local zip artifact.

      - We have improved our reference pipeline to allow for the build of a single product.

      - We've made several CI/CD enhancements to improve Image qualification (smoke/integration tests).

      We've made enhancements to explicitly send the variables to be substituted.
