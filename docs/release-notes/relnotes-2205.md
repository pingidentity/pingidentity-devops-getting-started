### Resolved Defects

- (BRASS-402) - Updates to PingAccess and PingFederate
  -  Updated the PingAccess and PingFederate builds to generate a run.properties.subst.default file based on the product default run.properties file pulled from /opt/server. This ensures that any other defaults in the product are included in the default run.properties. This change allows for setting the PingAccess operational mode through the OPERATIONAL_MODE environment variable, without requiring a server profile.
- (BRASS-428) - PingAccess FIPS mode properties issues
  - Updated the default FIPS properties file for PingAccess to use the correct filename and the correct property name to enable FIPS mode.

### Enhancements
- **Docker Images**
    - Apache Tomcat to Version 9.0.63
    - Alpine to version 3.16.0

### Features
- (BRASS-434) Support Null SecurityContext in Helm Charts for Openshift
    - Enables the helm charts to generate with workload.securityContext as null, permitting the Openshift environment to generate the security context properly.
