### Resolved Defects

- (BRASS-389) - Fix an issue with the getSemanticImageVersion function that was causing "bad number" errors during hook scripts.
- (BRASS-397) - Updated PingDirectory and PingFederate server profiles to remove hard-coded instances of dc=example,dc=com and replace them with the USER_BASE_DN environment variable.

### Enhancements
- **Docker Images**
    - Apache Tomcat to Version 9.0.62
    - Alpine to version 3.15.4
    - Liberica JDK to 11.0.15+10

###Features
- (BRASS-393) PingDirectory supports multiple base DNS for replication
    - Updated the PingDirectory image to support enabling and initializing replication for multiple base DNs with the REPLICATION_BASE_DNS variable, in addition to the USER_BASE_DN variable. Multiple DNs can be delimited with a ';' character.  
        - For example:  REPLICATION_BASE_DNS=dc=additional,dc=com;dc=another,dc=com
- (BRASS-394) PingDataSync supports persistent volume for restarts
    - Updated the PingDataSync restart logic to include use of the manage-profile replace-profile command to support running PingDataSync with a persistent volume. This allows for updating the PingDataSync configuration on container restart, without requiring deploying a fresh container or volume.
