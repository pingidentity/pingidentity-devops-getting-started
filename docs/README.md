# Ping Identity DevOps

We enable DevOps professionals, administrators and developers with tools, frameworks, blueprints and reference architectures to deploy Ping Identity software in the cloud.

## Why Ping Identity solutions for DevOps?

* **Streamlined deployments**

  Deploy and run workloads on our solutions without the need for additional hardware or VMs.

* **Consistent and flexible**

  Maintain all configurations and dependencies, ensuring consistent environments. Containers are portable and can be used on nearly any machine.

* **Optimized sizing**

  Orchestration of containers allows organizations to increase fault tolerance, availability, and better manage costs by auto-scaling to application demand.

## Get started

See [Getting started](docs/evaluate.md) to quickly deploy a preconfigured DevOps image of a Ping Identity solution or integrated set of solutions.
