# Deploy an Example Stack

!!! note "Video Demonstration"
    A video demonstration of this example is available [here](https://videos.pingidentity.com/detail/videos/devops/video/6313575361112/getting-started-walkthrough).

!!! note "Versions Used"
    This example was written using Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled on the Mac platform.  The version used for this guide was `4.19.0 (106363)`, which includes Docker Engine `v23.0.5` and Kubernetes `v1.25.9`.  The ingress-nginx controller version was `1.8.0`, deployed from Helm chart version `4.7.0`.

!!! note "Kubernetes Services Kubernetes versus Server-Deployed Applications"

    If you are new to Kubernetes-based deployments, there is a distinct difference when running under Kubernetes compared to running applications on servers.  In a server model, many applications typically run on the same server, and you can access any of them using the same host. For example, many on-premise deployments of PingFederate also include the PingDataConsole, hosted on the same server.

    Under Kubernetes, however, each application that requires external access is associated with a `service`.  A service is a fixed endpoint in the cluster that routes traffic to a given application.  So, in this example, there are distinct service endpoints for PingFederate, PingDataConsole, and the other products.  

    In this demo, these service endpoints are load balanced using the Nginx ingress controller. By adding entries to the `/etc/hosts` file, you can access them using typical URL entries.

The Ping Identity Helm [Getting Started](https://helm.pingidentity.com/getting-started/) page has instructions on getting your environment configured for using the Ping Helm charts.

For more examples, see [Helm Chart Example Configurations](../deployment/deployHelm.md).

For more information on Helm with Ping products, see [Ping Identity DevOps Helm Charts](https://helm.pingidentity.com).

## What You Will Do

After using Git to clone the `pingidentity-devops-getting-started` repository, you will use Helm to deploy a sample stack to a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

* Register for the Ping DevOps program and install/configure `pingctl` with your User and Key
* Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
* Follow the instructions on the helm [Getting Started](https://helm.pingidentity.com/getting-started/) page up through updating to the latest charts to ensure you have the latest version of our charts
* Access to a Kubernetes cluster. You can enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop for a simple cluster, which was the cluster used for this guide (on the Mac platform).

## Clone the `getting-started` repository

1. Clone the `pingidentity-devops-getting-started` repository to your local `${PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_HOME}` directory.

    !!! note "The `${PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_HOME}` environment variable was set by running `pingctl config`."

    ```sh
    cd "${PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_HOME}"
    git clone \
      https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-devops-getting-started.git
    ```

## Deploy the example stack

1. Deploy the example stack of our product containers.

    !!! warning "Initial Deployment"
        For this guide, avoid making changes to the `everything.yaml` file to ensure a successful first-time deployment.

    1. Create a namespace for running the stack in your Kubernetes cluster.  

         ```sh
         # Create the namespace
         kubectl create ns pinghelm

         # Set the kubectl context to the namespace
         kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=pinghelm

         # Confirm
         kubectl config view --minify | grep namespace:
         ```

    1. Deploy the ingress controller to Docker Desktop:

         ```sh
         helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx \
         --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx \
         --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace
         ```

    1. To wait for the Nginx ingress to reach a healthy state, run the following command.  You can also observe the pod status using k9s or by running `kubectl get pods --namespace ingress-nginx`. You should see one controller pod running when the ingress controller is ready.  This command should exit after no more than 90 seconds or so, depending on the speed of your computer:

        ```sh
        kubectl wait --namespace ingress-nginx \
          --for=condition=ready pod \
          --selector=app.kubernetes.io/component=controller \
          --timeout=90s
        ```

    1. Create a secret in the namespace you will be using to run the example (pinghelm) using the `pingctl` utility. This secret will obtain an evaluation license based on your Ping DevOps username and key:

         ```sh
         pingctl k8s generate devops-secret | kubectl apply -f -
         ```

    1.  This example will use the Helm release name `demo` and DNS domain suffix `*pingdemo.example` for accessing applications.  Add all expected hosts to `/etc/hosts`:

        ```sh
        echo '127.0.0.1 demo-pingaccess-admin.pingdemo.example demo-pingaccess-engine.pingdemo.example demo-pingauthorize.pingdemo.example demo-pingauthorizepap.pingdemo.example demo-pingdataconsole.pingdemo.example demo-pingdelegator.pingdemo.example demo-pingdirectory.pingdemo.example demo-pingfederate-admin.pingdemo.example demo-pingfederate-engine.pingdemo.example demo-pingcentral.pingdemo.example' | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts > /dev/null
        ```

    1. To install the chart, go to your local `"${PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_HOME}"/pingidentity-devops-getting-started/30-helm` directory and run the command shown here.  In this example, the release (deployment into Kubernetes by Helm) is called `demo`, forming the prefix for all objects created. The `ingress-demo.yaml` file configures the ingresses for the products to use the **_ping-local_** domain:

        ```sh
        helm upgrade --install demo pingidentity/ping-devops -f everything.yaml -f ingress-demo.yaml
        ```

        The latest product Docker images are automatically downloaded if they have not previously been pulled from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/pingidentity/).

        Sample output:

        As you can see, PingAccess Admin and Engine, PingData Console, PingDirectory, PingAuthorize, and the PingFederate Admin and Engine are deployed from the provided `everything.yaml` values file.

        It will take several minutes for all components to become operational.

     1. To display the status of the deployed components, you can use [k9s](https://k9scli.io/) or issue the corresponding commands shown here:

           * Display the services (endpoints for connecting) by running `kubectl get service --selector=app.kubernetes.io/instance=demo`

           * To view the pods, run `kubectl get pods --selector=app.kubernetes.io/instance=demo` - you will need to run this at intervals until all pods have started (** Running ** status):

           ```text

           ```

           * To see the ingresses you will use to access the product, run `kubectl get ingress`. If the ingress controller is configured properly, you should see `localhost` as the address as shown here:

           ```text
           NAME                       CLASS    HOSTS                                     ADDRESS     PORTS     AGE

           ```

        !!! error "Address must be localhost"
            If the ingress controller is working properly, the ingress definitions will all report the ADDRESS column as `localhost` as shown above.  If you do not see this entry, then you will not be able to access the services later.  This problem is due to a known error with Docker Desktop and the embedded virtual machine (VM) used on the Mac and Windows platform in combination with the ingress controller. To correct the problem, uninstall the chart as instructed at the bottom of this page and restart Docker Desktop.  Afterward, you can re-run the helm command to install the Ping products as instructed above.  The [issue appears to be related to a stale networking configuration](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/issues/7686) under the covers of Docker Desktop.


           * To see everything tied to the helm release run `kubectl get all --selector=app.kubernetes.io/instance=demo`:

           * To view logs, look at the logs for the deployment of the product in question.  For example:

           ```text
            kubectl logs -f deployment/demo-pingfederate-admin
           ```

2. These are the URLs and credentials to sign on to the management consoles for the products.

    !!! note "Certificates"
        This example uses self-signed certificates that will have to be accepted in your browser or added to your keystore.

    With the ingresses in place, you can access the products at these URLs:

    | Product | Connection Details |
    | --- | --- |
    | [PingFederate](https://demo-pingfederate-admin.pingdemo.example/pingfederate/app) | <ul> <li>URL: [https://demo-pingfederate-admin.pingdemo.example/pingfederate/app](https://demo-pingfederate-admin.pingdemo.example/pingfederate/app)</li><li>Username: administrator</li><li>Password: 2FederateM0re</li></ul> |
    | [PingDirectory](https://demo-pingdataconsole.pingdemo.example/console) | <ul><li>URL: [https://demo-pingdataconsole.pingdemo.example/console](https://demo-pingdataconsole.pingdemo.example/console)</li><li>Server: ldaps://demo-pingdirectory-cluster:1636</li><li>Username: administrator</li><li>Password: 2FederateM0re</li></ul> |

3. When you are finished, you can remove the demonstration components by running the uninstall command for helm:

    ```sh
    helm uninstall demo
    ```

## Next Steps

Now that you have deployed a set of our product images using the provided chart, you can move on to deployments using configurations that more closely reflect use cases to be explored.  Refer to the [helm examples](../deployment/deployHelm.md)) page for other typical deployments.

!!! warning "Container logging"
    Maintaining logs in a containerized model is different from the typical server-deployed application.  See [this page](../reference/containerLogging.md) for additional details.
