# Introduction
This section outlines ways to easily deploy Ping products with pre-defined configurations.  After you have successfully deployed using these examples, you can move on to customizing the products to fit your needs and environment.

You will need to [register for the Ping DevOps program](../how-to/devopsRegistration.md) in order to obtain trial licenses for evaluating or testing with our products.

After registering at the link above, you will be provided a username and key.  These credentials provide a temporary license for your evaluation.  See [using your DevOps User and Key](../how-to/devopsUserKey.md) for instructions on use.

Finally, to manage PingOne resources using credentials other than your own, you are required to have a PingOne Worker App. See [this configuration page](../reference/pingone-config.md) for more details on configuration.
