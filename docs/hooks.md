# Using DevOps hooks

Our DevOps hooks are build-specific scripts that are called or can be called by the `entrypoint.sh` script that is used start up our product containers. 

    > Use of our DevOps hooks is intended only for DevOps professionals.

The available hooks are built with the DevOps images, and can be found in the `hooks` subdirectory of each product directory in the [Docker builds](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-docker-builds) repository. 

In the `entrypoint.sh` startup script, there is an example (stub) provided for the available hooks for all products.

    > It is **critical** that the supplied hook names be used if a you modify `entrypoint.sh` (for example, to make subtle changes to a server profile).

## Using .pre and .post hooks

When DevOps hooks are called during the entrypoint process, any corresponding `.pre` and `.post` hooks will also be called.

Hooks with a `.pre` extension are run before the corresponding hook, and hooks with a `.post` extension are run after the corresponding hook. For example, a script named `80-post-start.sh.pre` will be run just before the `80-post-start.sh` hook starts, and a script named `80-post-start.sh.post` will be run just after that hook completes.

These extensions allow you to define custom scripts to be executed before or after any hook that is run in the container. You can include any custom `.pre` and `.post` hooks in the `hooks` directory of your server profile.
