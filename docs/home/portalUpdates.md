## Removal of docker-compose examples

With the focus of using Helm to provision to Kubernetes as our recommended practice, the older Docker Compose examples were no longer maintained or supported.  The only examples that remain are for single-product deployments.

## Removal of many Kubernetes Kustomize examples

As with Docker Compose, we also originally used Kustomize for our Kubernetes examples.  Many of those examples have been replaced by Helm, and therefore the Kustomize examples were also removed from this portal.

## Confirmation of Examples and How-Tos

We received reports in recent weeks that some of the older examples were not working due to changes in Kubernetes version support and other reasons. All remaining examples and guides on this portal have been reviewed and should work as written.
