# The `pingctl` Utility

`pingctl` is our general DevOps command-line utility.

!!! note "Deprecated file name"
    The deprecated ping-devops utility used a configuration file located at ~/.pingidentity/devops.  pingctl, however, uses ~/.pingidentity/config.  While the files generated are compatible, be aware that some older utilities or documentation might refer to the older configuration name.

## Dependent Utilities

* openssl
* base64

* envsubst
