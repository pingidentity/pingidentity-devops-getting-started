To ensure that your environment is configured correctly to run the 
Ping Identity DevOps products, you can run the following command to 
test your ~/.pingidentity/config file has been setup correctly.

    docker run --env-file ${HOME}/.pingidentity/config alpine env | sort

The output should look something like this:

    > docker run --env-file ${HOME}/.pingidentity/config alpine env | sort
    HOME=/root
    HOSTNAME=cc4008ce6105
    PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin
    PING_IDENTITY_ACCEPT_EULA=YES
    PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_HOME=......
    PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY=.......
    PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_REGISTRY=docker.io/pingidentity
    PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_TAG=edge
    PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER=......

If the PING_IDENTITY_... variables are missing, then either:

 1. Your ${HOME}/.pingidentity/config folder hasn't been configured correctly.
    You can fix this with:

      ping-devops config

 2. In some cases (mostly on some linux variants) the variables are getting
    sourced correctly.  Ensure that your .bash_profile (bash) or .zshrc (zsh)
    are sourcing:

      ${HOME}/.pingidentity/config

    In some linux distros (i.e. Ubuntu), you may also need to set allexports 
    by adding

      set -a
