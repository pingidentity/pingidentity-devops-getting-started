Registering for our DevOps program grants you credentials that can be
provided as variables to our containers. This streamlines license issues
by allowing the container to automatically retrieve an evaluation license
upon container startup.

    **************************************************************
    ***  Evaluation licenses are short-lived and NOT intended  ***
    ***  for use in production deployments.                    ***
    **************************************************************

Follow these 2 steps to register:

 1. Create a Ping Identity account, or verify sign on to your existing
    account.

       https://www.pingidentity.com/en/account/sign-on.html

  2. Request your DevOps key.

       https://devops.pingidentity.com/get-started/devopsRegistration/

     Your DevOps user name and key will be sent to your email. This will
     generally take only a few business hours.

  3. Upon receiving your PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER and
     PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY add them to your config using command:

       ping-devops config

For ease of use, we recommend you use the DevOps user name and key approach
when evaluating our container use-cases. However, if you'd rather use an
existing Ping Identity product license, see the following documentation.
