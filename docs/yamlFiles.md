# Customizing YAML files

Docker Compose uses YAML files to configure a stack's containers on startup. You can customize our YAML files or use them as the basis for creating your own. See the Docker [Compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) for more information.

Some examples of how you can customize our YAML files:

  * Add or change environment variables to use different server profiles.
  * Add references to a file or files containing environment variables to pass to the container on startup.
  * Change the `wait-for` times used to control the startup sequence of containers.
  * Change the port mappings for a container.
  * Change the release tag used for the Docker images (all product containers in the stack must use the same release tag). See [Using release tags](releaseTags.md) for more information.

You'll find the YAML files for the DevOps example stacks located in your `${HOME}/projects/devops/pingidentity-devops-getting-started/11-docker-compose` subdirectories.

## YAML file format

Here's the format we use for our YAML files:

```yaml
version: "3.1"

services:
    <ping-product>:
      image: pingidentity/<ping-product>:${PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_TAG}
      command: wait-for <another-ping-product>:<startup-port> -t <time-to-wait> -- entrypoint.sh start-server
      environment: 
        - SERVER_PROFILE_URL=https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-server-profiles.git
        - SERVER_PROFILE_PATH=baseline/<ping-product>
        - PING_IDENTITY_ACCEPT_EULA=YES
      env_file:
        - ~/.pingidentity/devops
      #volumes:
        # - ${HOME}/projects/devops/volumes/full-stack.<ping-product>:/opt/out
        # - ${HOME}/projects/devops/pingidentity-server-profiles/baseline/<ping-product>:/opt/in
      ports:
        - <host-port>:<container-port>
        - <host-port>:<container-port>
      networks:
        - pingnet-dmz
            
networks:
    pingnet-internal:
    pingnet-dmz:
```

| Entry | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `version` | The Docker Compose version used. |
| `<ping-product>` | The name of the Ping Identity product container. |
| `image` | The build image of the product used for the container, and the build tag to use (defaults to value assigned to `PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_TAG` in the `~/.pingidentity/devops` file. |
| `command` | We use the `wait-for` script to control the startup order, where `<startup-port>` is the port to check for whether `<another-ping-product>` container has started. The `<time-to-wait>` argument is the number of seconds to wait before executing the `entrypoint.sh` script with the `start-server` command. If you find a container is timing out while waiting for another container to start, try increasing the `<time-to-wait>` value. |
| `environment` | The environment variables being set. See [Customizing server profiles](profiles.md) for more information. The `PING_IDENTITY_ACCEPT_EULA` environment variable is set to "YES" when you complete the DevOps registration. This variable assignment appears here by default, but may also be in your `~/.pingidentity/devops` file. |
| `env_file` | A file or files containing environment variable settings. The DevOps environment settings are stored in your `~/.pingidentity/devops` file. You also can specify additional files containing environment settings. See [Customizing server profiles](profiles.md) for more information. |
| `volumes` | Commented out by default. The location bind mounted to the  `/opt/out` volume is used to persist product container state and data. The location bind mounted to the `/opt/in` volume is used to supply server profile information to the container on startup. See *Modify a server profile using local directories* in [Customizing server profiles](profiles.md) for more information. |
|`ports` | The port mappings between the host and the product container. See the *Ports* topic in the Docker [Compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/) for more information. |
| `networks` | One or more of the networks listed under the top-level `networks` key that the product container can use for Docker network communications. |
| top level `networks` | The Docker networks available for assignment to the containers in the stack. Our stacks are built to use an internal Docker network for communications between product containers (`pingnet-internal`) and an external-facing DMZ for external network communications (`pingnet-dmz`). |
