!!! error "Kustomize vs Helm"
    The examples in this section were written using [Kustomize](https://kustomize.io/) and `kubectl apply` as the method for deploying the products.  The use of kustomize is no longer supported or recommended and this documentation will be updated in the future to reflect this change.  For Kubernetes deployments, use the Helm charts provided by Ping.

# Orchestrate Deployments with Kubernetes

The Kubernetes examples contain configurations and scripts to orchestrate deployments of our DevOps images for:

* [Kubernetes For General Use](deployK8sGeneral.md)
* [Kubernetes For Cloud Platforms](deployK8sCloud.md), such as Amazon Web Services (AWS)
