# Working with DevOps Images

After you've deployed a set of our DevOps Images using the full-stack server profile in [Get Started](../get-started/getStarted.md), you're set up to move on to deployments using server profiles that may more closely reflect use cases you want to test out. Your choices at this point are:

* Continue working with the full-stack server profile in your local `pingidentity-devops-getting-started/11-docker-compose/03-full-stack` directory.
* Try our other server profiles in your local `pingidentity-devops-getting-started` directory to quickly deploy typical use cases.
* Clone the [`pingidentity-server-profiles`](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-server-profiles) repository to your local `${HOME}/projects/devops` directory and discover the setup of specific product configurations.
