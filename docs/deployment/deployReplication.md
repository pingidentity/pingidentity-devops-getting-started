# Deploying a Replicated PingDirectory Pair

Use Docker compose to deploy a replicated pair of PingDirectory containers.

## Before you begin
You must complete [Get Started](../get-started/getStarted.md) to set up your DevOps environment and run a test deployment of the products.

## About this task

You will:

* Deploy the replicated pair.
* Test the deployment.
* Bring down or stop the stack.

## Deploying the stack

1. Go to your local `devops/pingidentity-devops-getting-started/11-docker-compose/02-replicated-pair` directory and enter:

      ```sh
      docker-compose up -d
      ```

      This kicks off a PingDirectory instance that will stand up, become healthy, and then go into a loop looking for other directories.

1. Scale up instances.

      ```sh
      docker-compose up -d --scale pingdirectory=2
      ```

1. At intervals, check to see when the containers are healthy and running:

      ```sh
      docker-compose ps
      ```

      * You can also display the startup logs:

        ```sh
        docker-compose logs -f
        ```

      * To see the logs for a particular product container at any point, enter:

        ```sh
        docker-compose logs <product-container-name>
        ```

    !!! note "DevOps Aliases"
        Enter `dhelp` for a listing of the DevOps command aliases. See the [Docker Compose Command Line Reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/) for the Docker compose commands.

1. To view the running instance, sign on to PingDirectory using the PingData Console:

      | Product | Connection Details |
    | --- | --- |
    | [PingDirectory](https://localhost:8443/console) | <ul><li>URL: [https://localhost:8443/console](https://localhost:8443/console)</li><li>Server: pingdirectory:1636</li><li>Username: administrator</li><li>Password: 2FederateM0re</li></ul> |

## Testing the deployment

1. Verify that data is replicating between the pair by adding a description entry for the first container:

   * Exec into the container.

      ```sh
      docker container exec -it \
         02-replicated-pair_pingdirectory_1 \
         /opt/out/instance/bin/ldapmodify

      ...
      # Successfully connected to localhost:1636
      ```

    * Copy and paste this entire block:

         ```sh
         dn: uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
         changetype: modify
         replace: description
         description: Made this change on the first container.

         <Ctrl-D>
         ```

         > The blank line followed by the `<Ctrl-D>` is important. It's how entries are separated in the LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF).

1. To check that the second container in the pair now has a matching entry for the description, enter:

      ```text
      docker container exec -it \
         02-replicated-pair_pingdirectory_2 \
         /opt/out/instance/bin/ldapsearch \
         -b uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com \
         -s base '(&)' description
      ```

      The result shows the description that you specified for the first container, similar to the following:

      ```text
      # dn: uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
      # description: Made this change on the first container.
      ```

## Cleaning up

When you no longer want to run this stack, bring the stack down.

* To remove all of the containers and associated Docker networks, enter:

      ```sh
      docker-compose down
      ```

* To stop the running stack without removing any of the containers or associated Docker networks, enter:

      ```sh
      docker-compose stop
      ```

* To remove attached Docker volumes, enter:

      ```sh
      docker volume prune
      ```
