# Deploy a PingFederate and PingDirectory Stack

You'll use Docker Compose to deploy a PingFederate and PingDirectory stack.

## What You'll Do

* Deploy the stack.
* Log in to the management consoles.
* Bring down or stop the stack.

## Prerequisites

* You've already been through [Get Started](../get-started/getStarted.md) to set up your DevOps environment and run a test deployment of the products.

## Deploy Stack

1. Go to your local `pingidentity-devops-getting-started/11-docker-compose/01-simple-stack` directory. Enter:

      ```sh
      docker-compose up -d
      ```

1. Check that the containers are healthy and running:

      ```sh
      docker-compose ps
      ```

      To display the startup logs:

      ```sh
      docker-compose logs -f
      ```

      To see the logs for a particular product container at any point, enter:

      ```sh
      docker-compose logs <product-container-name>
      ```

1. Log in to the management consoles:

      | Product | Connection Details |
    | --- | --- |
    | [PingFederate](https://localhost:9999/pingfederate/app) | <ul> <li>URL: [https://localhost:9999/pingfederate/app](https://localhost:9999/pingfederate/app)</li><li>Username: administrator</li><li>Password: 2FederateM0re</li></ul> |
    | [PingDirectory](https://localhost:8443/console) | <ul><li>URL: [https://localhost:8443/console](https://localhost:8443/console)</li><li>Server: pingdirectory</li><li>Username: administrator</li><li>Password: 2FederateM0re</li></ul> |

## Clean Up

When you no longer want to run this stack, you can either stop the running stack, or bring the stack down.

To stop the running stack without removing any of the containers or associated Docker networks, enter:

```sh
docker-compose stop
```

To remove all of the containers and associated Docker networks, enter:

```sh
docker-compose down
```

To remove attached Docker Volumes

```sh
docker volume prune
```
