# Docker Compose

!!! error "Deprecation"
    Docker Compose has been used by Ping in the past for basic orchestration and examples.  We are no longer maintaining any of the docker compose examples and they will be removed from this repository in the future.  The recommended and supported method for deploying Ping product containers is Helm on Kubernetes.

Docker Compose provides light orchestration of containers, supporting the deployment of stack of containers quickly on a single host using configurations specified in YAML files.

To deploy typical use cases, try the examples for Docker Compose in your local `pingidentity-devops-getting-started/11-docker-compose` directory.

For more information about the structure of Docker Compose YAML files provided by Ping, see [this page](../reference/yamlFiles.md)
