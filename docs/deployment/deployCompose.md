# Deploy with Docker-Compose

We use Docker Compose for light orchestration of containers, deploying a stack of containers quickly, on a single host, based on configurations specified in YAML files.

Try the examples for Docker Compose in your local `pingidentity-devops-getting-started/11-docker-compose` directory to easily deploy typical use cases.
