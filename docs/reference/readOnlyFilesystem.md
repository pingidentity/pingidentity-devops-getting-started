title: Running Ping product images with a read-only root filesystem requirement
---
# Running product containers with a read-only root filesystem

## Overview

In some environments, there is a requirement that the container filesystem be read-only.  Our product images are maturing to support this capability natively in the future.  In the meantime, this guide will explain the overall concepts and provide an example with PingDirectory.  The other product images can operate in a similar manner.  

!!! warning "Example only"
    This guide is intended to provide an example implementation of solving this problem; your situation might require a different approach.

!!! note "Ping image exploration"
    An excellent starting point for understanding what goes on with our containers as they are instantiated can be found in [this video](https://videos.pingidentity.com/detail/videos/devops/video/6314748082112/ping-product-docker-image-exploration).  It is highly recommended that you take the time to view it prior to working through this guide.

### High-level process

In Ping product containers, the layered approach of bringing the environment and configuration parameters into the container at launch requires merging of files from server profiles and possibly other locations before the product is launched.  This process means that files are modified at runtime, and a read-only root filesystem blocks this action.  The overall approach is to use [emptyDir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir) volumes to overlay the directories that need modification, allowing the hook scripts to run as normal against the volume rather than the container filesystem.  In order to get everything necessary for the scripts in place, an init container (using the same image as the product container) is launched and the files necessary are copied to the shared volume before starting the product container.

## Prerequisites

- [kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/) CLI utility to serve as a [post-renderer](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/advanced/#post-rendering) for Helm.

## File explanation

In the **30-helm/read-only-filesystem** folder of the [Getting Started repository](https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-devops-getting-started) is a values file and kustomize directory.  First, we will explore the the `pd-values.yaml` file; inline comments explain what is going on:

!!! note "Kustomize"
    **Kustomize is used as the Ping helm charts do not support setting the readOnlyFileSystem value to the securityContext of a container at this time.**

In the **30-helm/read-only-filesystem/kustomize** subdirectory is a kustomize script and definition file.

The script simply runs kustomize:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

cat <&0 > kustomize/all.yaml

kustomize build kustomize && rm kustomize/all.yaml
```

The `kustomization.yaml` file sets the **securityContext** for the each container's root file system to read-only:

```yaml
resources:
  - all.yaml

patches:
  - target:
      group: apps
      version: v1
      kind: StatefulSet
    patch: |-
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/containers/0/securityContext
        value:
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
      - op: add
        path: /spec/template/spec/initContainers/0/securityContext
        value:
          readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
```

## Process

To use the example files to deploy PingDirectory with a read-only root filesystem, follow the steps here:

1.  Generate a license file and create a secret.  If you have an existing license file, you can use it here:

    ```bash
    # Generate the license file
    pingctl license pingdirectory 9.2 > PingDirectory.lic

    # Create the secret to match the name in the values file:
    kubectl create secret generic pingdirectory-license --from-file=./PingDirectory.lic
    ```

1.  Update the **`30-helm/read-only-filesystem/pd-values.yaml`** file with the appropriate image tag and release name to be used with Helm.  Afterward, use Helm to deploy the release:

    ```bash
    # For this example, the release name of 'rofs' is used
    cd 30-helm/read-only-filesystem
    helm upgrade --install rofs pingidentity/ping-devops -f './pd-values.yaml' \
          --post-renderer kustomize/kustomize
    ```

## Diagram

This image provides an overview of what happens.  It is best viewed in a separate tab:

![Read-Only Root Filesystem Example](../images/readOnlyFileSystem.png)

!!! note "/etc/motd"
    One issue we encountered is that the **`/etc/motd`** file can be modified at startup by hook scripts, but /etc/ is read-only.  We are exploring ways to address this in some way, but at this time, it appears one possible solution is to treat `/etc/` in the same manner as /opt/staging (copying to an emptyDir) if the `motd` file is to be updated.  However, `/etc` has many more files and directories and such a solution is not practical.  Baking it into a custom image is another possibility.
