# Docker Builds - Hooks

**Audience** - Operators of DevOps Cloud environments. Not intended for Developers and admins of the Ping Identity products. Those documents are available via the server-profile `need link here to server-profile doc`.

**Description** - This document describes the many number of scripts that are called in during the lifecyle of a Ping Identity docker image from the initial `entrypoint.sh` script.

Included with the base docker images, there is an example/stub provided for all possible hooks. It is **very important** that these names be used if a developer wishes to make subtle changes to their server-profile `need link here to server-profile doc`.

The full ordered list of scripts that are called depending on what type of image \(i.e. pingdirectory or pingdatasync\) are:
