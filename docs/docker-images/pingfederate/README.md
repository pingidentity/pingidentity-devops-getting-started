Each tag cannot contain any spaces. Other characters are allowed.  Example 1: PF_NODE_TAGS=north Example 1 defines one tag: 'north' Example 2: PF_NODE_TAGS=1 123 test Example 2 defines three tags: '1', '123' and 'test'  Example 3: PF_NODE_TAGS= Example 3 is also valid because the PF_NODE_TAGS property is optional.  |

To run a PingFederate container:

```shell
  docker run \
           --name pingfederate \
           --publish 9999:9999 \
           --detach \
           --env SERVER_PROFILE_URL=https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-server-profiles.git \

           --env PING_IDENTITY_ACCEPT_EULA=YES \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY \
           --tmpfs /run/secrets \
           pingidentity/pingfederate:edge
```

Follow Docker logs with:

```
docker logs -f pingfederate
```
