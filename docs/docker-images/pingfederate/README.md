Configuration is optional. When configured, PingFederate takes this property into consideration when processing requests. For example, tags may be used to determine the data store location that this PingFederate node communicates with. Administrators may also use tags in conjunction with authentication selectors and policies to define authentication requirements.  Administrators may define one tag or a list of space-separated tags. Each tag cannot contain any spaces. Other characters are allowed.  Example 1: PF_NODE_TAGS=north Example 1 defines one tag: 'north' Example 2: PF_NODE_TAGS=1 123 test Example 2 defines three tags: '1', '123' and 'test'  Example 3: PF_NODE_TAGS= Example 3 is also valid because the PF_NODE_TAGS property is optional.

## Ports Exposed

The following ports are exposed from the container.  If a variable is
used, then it may come from a parent container

- 9031
- 9999

## Running a PingFederate container
To run a PingFederate container:

```shell
  docker run \
           --name pingfederate \
           --publish 9999:9999 \
           --detach \
           --env SERVER_PROFILE_URL=https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-server-profiles.git \
           --env SERVER_PROFILE_PATH=getting-started/pingfederate \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_ACCEPT_EULA=YES \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY \
           --tmpfs /run/secrets \
           pingidentity/pingfederate:edge
```

Follow Docker logs with:

```
docker logs -f pingfederate
```

If using the command above with the embedded [server profile](https://devops.pingidentity.com/reference/config/), log in with:
* https://localhost:9999/pingfederate/app
  * Username: Administrator
  * Password: 2FederateM0re
