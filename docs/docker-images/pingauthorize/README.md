## Ports Exposed

The following ports are exposed from the container.  If a variable is
used, then it may come from a parent container

- ${LDAP_PORT}
- ${LDAPS_PORT}
- ${HTTPS_PORT}
- ${JMX_PORT}

## Running a PingAuthorize container

The easiest way to test a simple standalone image of PingAuthorize is to cut/paste the following command into a terminal on a machine with docker.

```sh
  docker run \
           --name pingauthorize \
           --publish 1389:1389 \
           --publish 8443:1443 \
           --detach \
           --env SERVER_PROFILE_URL=https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-server-profiles.git \
           --env SERVER_PROFILE_PATH=getting-started/pingauthorize \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_ACCEPT_EULA=YES \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY \
           --tmpfs /run/secrets \
          pingidentity/pingauthorize:edge
```

You can view the Docker logs with the command:

```sh
  docker logs -f pingauthorize
```

You should see the ouptut from a PingAuthorize install and configuration, ending with a message the the PingAuthorize has
started.  After it starts, you will see some typical access logs.  Simply ``Ctrl-C`` after to stop tailing the logs.


## Stopping/Removing the container
To stop the container:

```
  docker container stop pingauthorize
```

To remove the container:

```
  docker container rm -f pingauthorize
```
