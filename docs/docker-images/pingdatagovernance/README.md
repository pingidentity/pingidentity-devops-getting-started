# Ping Identity DevOps Docker Image - `pingdatagovernance`

This docker image includes the Ping Identity PingDataGovernance product binaries
and associated hook scripts to create and run a PingDataGovernance instance or
instances.

## Related Docker Images
- `pingidentity/pingbase` - Parent Image
> This image inherits, and can use, Environment Variables from [pingidentity/pingbase](https://devops.pingidentity.com/docker-images/pingbase/)
- `pingidentity/pingdatacommon` - Common Ping files (i.e. hook scripts)

## Introducing PingAuthorize™
Starting with the 8.3 release, PingDataGovernance has been renamed to PingAuthorize. Customers are increasingly applying
the product to general, externalized, and dynamic authorization use cases, beyond the original privacy and data protection
use cases of PingDataGovernance, and Ping Identity has updated the name to reflect the growing trend and application of
Dynamic Authorization.

## Running a PingDataGovernance container

The easiest way to test a simple standalone image of PingDataGovernance is to cut/paste the following command into a terminal on a machine with docker.

```sh
  docker run \
           --name pingdatagovernance \
           --publish 1389:1389 \
           --publish 8443:1443 \
           --detach \
           --env SERVER_PROFILE_URL=https://github.com/pingidentity/pingidentity-server-profiles.git \
           --env SERVER_PROFILE_PATH=getting-started/pingdatagovernance \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_ACCEPT_EULA=YES \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_USER \
           --env PING_IDENTITY_DEVOPS_KEY \
           --tmpfs /run/secrets \
          pingidentity/pingdatagovernance:edge
```

You can view the Docker logs with the command:

```sh
  docker logs -f pingdatagovernance
```

You should see the output from a PingDataGovernance install and configuration, ending with a message the the PingDataGovernance has
started.  After it starts, you will see some typical access logs.  Simply ``Ctrl-C`` after to stop tailing the logs.
