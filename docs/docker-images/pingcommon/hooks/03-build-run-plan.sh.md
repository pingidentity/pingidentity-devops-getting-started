# Ping Identity DevOps `pingcommon` Hook - `03-build-run-plan.sh`
 This script will building a run plan for the server as it starts up
 Options for the RUN_PLAN and the PD_STATE are as follows:
 RUN_PLAN (Initially set to UNKNOWN)
          START   - Instructs the container to start from scratch.  This is primarily
                    because a SERVER_ROOT_DIR (i.e. /opt/out/instance) isn't preseent.
          RESTART - Instructs the container to restart.  This is primarily because the
                    SERVER_ROOT_DIR (i.e. /opt/out/instance) is prsent.
 > NOTE: It will be common for products to override this hook to provide
 > RUN_PLAN directions based on product specifics.
