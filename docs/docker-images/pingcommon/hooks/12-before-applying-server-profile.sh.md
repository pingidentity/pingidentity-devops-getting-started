# Ping Identity DevOps `pingcommon` Hook - `12-before-applying-server-profile.sh`
This script is called after the product bits have been copied over to the runtime location
and before the remote server profile gets applied on to the staging area

if the remote server profile is to be layered over a local sever profile provided via the
${IN_DIR} volume mount, you could use this hook to manipulate the local server profile in
the staging area to avoid certain file from being overridden for example
