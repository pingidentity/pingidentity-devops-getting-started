# Ping Identity DevOps `pingcommon` Hook - `07-apply-server-profile.sh`
 The server-profiles from:
 * remote (i.e. git) and
 * local (i.e. /opt/in)
 have been merged into the ${STAGING_DIR}/instance (ie. /opt/staging/instance).
 This is a candidate to be installed or overwritten into the ${SERVER_ROOT_DIR}
 if one of the following items are true:
 * Start of a new server (i.e. RUN_PLAN=START)
 * Restart of a server with SERVER_PROFILE_UPDATE==true
 To force the overwrite of files on a restart, ensure that the variable:
     SERVER_PROFILE_UPDATE=true
 is passed.
