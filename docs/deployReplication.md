# Deploy a replicated pair of PingDirectory containers

You'll use Docker Compose to deploy a replicated pair of PingDirectory containers.

## What you'll do

* Deploy the replicated pair.
* Test the deployment.
* Bring down or stop the stack.

## Prerequisites

* You've already been through [Get started](getStarted.md) to set up your DevOps environment and run a test deployment of the products.

## To deploy a replicated pair of PingDirectory containers:

1. Go to your local `devops/pingidentity-devops-getting-started/11-docker-compose/02-replicated-pair` directory. Enter:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --scale pingdirectory=2
   ```

2. At intervals, check to see when the containers are healthy and running:

   ```bash
   docker-compose ps
   ```

   You can also display the startup logs:

   ```bash
   docker-compose logs -f
   ```

   To see the logs for a particular product container at any point, enter:

   ```bash
   docker-compose logs <product-container-name>
   ```

   > Enter `dhelp` for a listing of the DevOps command aliases. See the [Docker Compose command line reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/overview/) for the Docker Compose commands.

3. To view the running instance, log in to PingDirectory using the Ping Data Console:

   * Ping Data Console for PingDirectory
     - Console URL: https://localhost:8443/console
     - Server: pingdirectory
     - User: Administrator
     - Password: 2FederateM0re

## Test the deployment

1. Verify that data is replicating between the pair by adding a description entry for the first container. Enter:

   ```text
   docker container exec -it 02-replicated-pair_pingdirectory_1 /opt/out/instance/bin/ldapmodify
   dn: uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
   changetype: modify
   replace: description
   description: Made this change on the first container.

   <Ctrl-D>
   ```

   > The blank line followed by the `<Ctrl-D>` is important. It's how entries are separated in the LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF).

2. Check that the second container in the pair now has a matching entry for the description. Enter:

    ```text
    docker container exec -it 02-replicated-pair_pingdirectory_2 /opt/out/instance/bin/ldapsearch -b uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com -s base '(&)' description
    ```

   The result should show the description that you specified for the first container, similar to this:

    ```text
    # dn: uid=user.0,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com
    # description: Made this change on the first container.
    ```

3. When you no longer want to run this full stack evaluation, you can either stop the running stack, or bring the stack down.

   To stop the running stack without removing any of the containers or associated Docker networks, enter:

   ```bash
   docker-compose stop
   ```

   To remove all of the containers and associated Docker networks, enter:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```
