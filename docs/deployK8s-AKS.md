# Deploy to Azure Kubernetes Service

This directory contains scripts and deployment files to help with the deployment, management and scaling of Ping Identity DevOps Docker Images to Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).

## Prerequisites

* You've already been through [Get Started](getStarted.md) to set up your DevOps environment and run a test deployment of the products.
* You've created a Kubernetes cluster on AKS. 
* You've created a Kubernetes secret using your DevOps credentials. See the *For Kubernetes* topic in [Using your DevOps user and key](devopsUserKey.md).
* You've downloaded and installed the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

We also highly recommend you are familiar with the information in these AKS articles:

* [Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/intro-kubernetes)

## Deploy our fullstack example in AKS

1. Create an Azure Resource Group to put all resources into. Enter:

   ```bash
   az group create \
       --name ping-devops-rg \
       --location westus
   ```

2. Create an Azure AKS cluster. You'll create a 2 node cluster. You need a public certificate, by default in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. Enter:

   ```bash
   az aks create \
       --resource-group ping-devops-rg \
       --name ping-devops-cluster \
       --node-count 2 \
       --enable-addons monitoring \
       --ssh-key-value ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```

3. Get the AKS Credentials into `.kube/config`. Enter:

   ```bash
   az aks get-credentials \
       --resource-group ping-devops-rg \
       --name ping-devops-cluster
   ```

4. From your local `pingidentity-devops-getting-started/20-kubernetes/02-fullstack` directory, start our fullstack example in AKS. Enter:

   ```bash
   ./setup -u fullstack
   ```

5. To display the status of the environment, enter:

   ```bash
   ./status
   ```

6. To clean up the environment, enter:

   ```bash
   ./cleanup -u fullstack
   ```

7. To clean up the Azure Resource Group and all associated resources, including the AKS cluster created, enter:

> **Caution**: This will remove everything you created that is associated with this resource group.

   ```bash
   az group delete \
       --name ping-devops-rg
   ```
