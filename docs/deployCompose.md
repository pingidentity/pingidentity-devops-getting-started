# Orchestrate with Docker-Compose

We use Docker-Compose for light orchestration of containers, deploying a stack of containers quickly, based on configurations specified in YAML files.

Try the server profiles for Docker-Compose in your local `pingidentity-devops-getting-started` directory to easily deploy typical use cases:

* [Deploy a PingFederate and PingDirectory stack](deployCompose.md).
* [Deploy a replicated PingDirectory pair](deployReplication.md).
* [Deploy PingDirectory with data synchronization using PingDataSync](deploySync.md).
* [Deploy a PingFederate cluster](docs/deployPfCluster.md)
* [Deploy a PingAccess cluster](docs/deployPaCluster.md)
* [Deploy PingCentral](deployPingCentral.md)
