# Security Warning

The server profiles referenced within this repository are for demo and documentation purposes only. They contain default keys/credentials etc and are not suitable for production and carry a substantial security risk.

Default master keys for this deployment are stored in this publically available repository, a production deployment would keep these files in a safe place to ensure the encryption at rest of production data is secure. As such, it is essential to cycle the keys in this repository before moving to production.
