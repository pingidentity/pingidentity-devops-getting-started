# Security Warning

The server profiles referenced within this repository are for demonstration and instructional purposes only. They contain default credentials and are not suitable for production, carrying a substantial security risk.

Default master keys for this deployment are stored in our publicly available repository. A production deployment would need to keep these files in a safe place to ensure the encryption and production data is secure. As such, it is essential that you cycle the keys used before moving to a production environment.
