#- The PingDataConsole can be configured to use SSO with PingOne. You will need to
#- configure an application with a redirect URL of https://localhost:8443/console/oidc/cb.
#- After you have configured the application in PingOne for the console, you can replace the
#- PD_CONSOLE_SSO_ISSUER_URI, PD_CONSOLE_SSO_CLIENT_ID, and PD_CONSOLE_SSO_CLIENT_SECRET
#- variables in this file with the corresponding values from PingOne. You will also need to
#- create a user in PingOne that corresponds to a root user DN configured in PingDirectory,
#- and that user will need to be given a password. The expected root user in this demo
#- is Jane Smith (username jsmith).
