For instructions on using the repository to build an image, visit this page.</p> <p>In the docker-builds Github repository, we share our Dockerfiles and automation scripts used for building Ping product container images.  You can use these scripts and supporting pieces found in the repository to build an image of your own locally.  For example, you can use this process to build an image for an older version we no longer provide on Docker Hub.</p> <p>The image build process at Ping uses the Docker multi-stage build process.  In summary, we build out image layers that are common to most or all of our products, and from those we add layers to refine and create the image for each product.  In doing so, we ensure that all of our product container images have a similar structure.  For example, all Ping products written in Java use the same Java runtime version in our images, since each product container image has the same JVM base image.</p> <p>As you explore the repository, you will find directories for building each product and supporting image, each with a Dockerfile and supporting scripts.  As these are layered, they build out a complete product image for use in Kubernetes or another container orchestration environment.  For the most part, each directory represents the source for an image, whether a final product image or an intermediate layer.  </p>"},{"location":"docker-builds/#filesystem-layout","title":"Filesystem layout","text":"<p>The repository includes the following directories.

PF_BC_FIPS_APPROVED_ONLY false Defines a variable that allows instantiating non-FIPS crypto/random PF_HSM_HYBRID false Hardware Security Module Hybrid Mode   When PF is in Hybrid mode, certs/keys can be created either on the local trust store or on the HSM.   This can used as a migration strategy towards an HSM setup. PF_RUN_PF_HSM_HYBRID will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_LDAP_TYPE PingDirectory This is the type of the LDAP directory server. This property is needed by PingFederate to determine how to handle different implementations between the available LDAP directory server types. Valid options include: ActiveDirectory, SunDirectoryServer, OracleUnifiedDirectory, PingDirectory, and Generic. PF_LDAP_USERNAME This is the username for an account within the LDAP Directory Server that can be used to perform user lookups for authentication and other user level search operations.  Set if PF_CONSOLE_AUTHENTICATION or PF_ADMIN_API_AUTHENTICATION=LDAP PF_LDAP_LDAP_USERNAME will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_LDAP_PASSWORD This is the password for the Username specified above. This property should be obfuscated using the 'obfuscate.sh' utility. Set if PF_CONSOLE_AUTHENTICATION or PF_ADMIN_API_AUTHENTICATION=LDAP PF_LDAP_LDAP_PASSWORD will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. CLUSTER_BIND_ADDRESS NON_LOOPBACK IP address for cluster communication.  Set to NON_LOOPBACK to allow the system to choose an available non-loopback IP address. PF_RUN_PF_CLUSTER_BIND_ADDRESS will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_PROVISIONER_MODE OFF Provisioner Mode in run.properties Options include OFF, STANDALONE, FAILOVER. PF_RUN_PF_PROVISIONER_MODE will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_PROVISIONER_NODE_ID 1 Provisioner Node ID in run.properties Initial active provisioning server node ID is 1 PF_RUN_PROVISIONER_NODE_ID will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_PROVISIONER_GRACE_PERIOD 600 Node group ID in cluster-adaptive.conf file. Does not require a .subst file. Provisioner Failover Grace Period in run.properties Grace period, in seconds. Default 600 seconds PF_RUN_PROVISIONER_FAILOVER_GRACE_PERIOD will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_JETTY_THREADS_MIN Override the default value for the minimum size of the Jetty thread pool Leave unset to let the container automatically tune the value according to available resources PF_RUN_PF_RUNTIME_THREADS_MIN will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_JETTY_THREADS_MAX Override the default value for the maximum size of the Jetty thread pool Leave unset to let the container automatically tune the value according to available resources PF_RUN_PF_RUNTIME_THREADS_MAX will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_ACCEPT_QUEUE_SIZE 512 The size of the accept queue. There is generally no reason to tune this but please refer to the performance tuning guide for further tuning guidance. PF_RUN_PF_RUNTIME_ACCEPTQUEUESIZE will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_PINGONE_REGION The region of the PingOne tenant PingFederate should connect with. Valid values are \"com\", \"eu\" and \"asia\" PF_RUN_PF_PINGONE_ADMIN_URL_REGION will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_PINGONE_ENV_ID The PingOne environment ID to use PF_RUN_PF_PINGONE_ADMIN_URL_ENVIRONMENT_ID will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_CONSOLE_TITLE Docker PingFederate The title featured in the administration console -- this is generally used to easily distinguish between environments PF_RUN_PF_CONSOLE_TITLE will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_NODE_TAGS This property defines the tags associated with this PingFederate node. Configuration is optional. When configured, PingFederate takes this property into consideration when processing requests. For example, tags may be used to determine the data store location that this PingFederate node communicates with. Administrators may also use tags in conjunction with authentication selectors and policies to define authentication requirements.  Administrators may define one tag or a list of space-separated tags. Each tag cannot contain any spaces. Other characters are allowed.  Example 1: PF_NODE_TAGS=north Example 1 defines one tag: 'north' Example 2: PF_NODE_TAGS=1 123 test Example 2 defines three tags: '1', '123' and 'test'  Example 3: PF_NODE_TAGS= Example 3 is also valid because the PF_NODE_TAGS property is optional. PF_RUN_NODE_TAGS will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. PF_CONSOLE_ENV This property defines the name of the PingFederate environment that will be displayed in the administrative console, used to make separate environments easily identifiable. PF_RUN_PF_CONSOLE_ENVIRONMENT will override this for PingFederate 11.3 and later. JAVA_RAM_PERCENTAGE 75.0 Percentage of the container memory to allocate to PingFederate JVM DO NOT set to 100% or your JVM will exit with OutOfMemory errors and the container will terminate BULK_CONFIG_DIR ${OUT_DIR}/instance/bulk-config BULK_CONFIG_FILE data.json ADMIN_WAITFOR_TIMEOUT 300 wait-for timeout for 80-post-start.sh hook script How long to wait for the PF Admin console to be available CREATE_INITIAL_ADMIN_USER false Set to true to create the initial admin user after PingFederate starts up. The initial admin user will only be created on the first startup of the server after the license is accepted.
