# NOTICE: the values in this file will override the values provided to the container
#         
#         if that is not the intent, and a default value should be set instead
#         use a syntax like:
#         export MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_0=${MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_0:=myDefaultValue}
#                or
#         export MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_1=${MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE_1:-wasNotSetElsewhere}
#         
#         Also be aware that many of these variable have default values set in the Docker image.
#         If that is the case the variable is never not set, you may have to override the value

# The location MUST be provided
export LOCATION=${LOCATION:-Docker}

# The root user may be provided (Default: cn=directory manager)
#ROOT_USER_DN=cn=administrator

# The path to the root user password file
# This does not necessarily need to be passed in to the container
# Default to /usr/local/secret to be passed via docker secrets
# Retrieve from a vault ideally instead of this
# NOTE: use ${BASE} in case the image was rebased
export ROOT_USER_PASSWORD_FILE=${BASE}/staging/pwd

# The replication administration user DN may be provided (Default: admin)
# ADMIN_USER_NAME=yourReplicationUserHere

# The replication administrator password file
ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD_FILE=${ROOT_USER_PASSWORD_FILE}


# The Java heap size may be provided
# MAX_HEAP_SIZE=384m

# The server certificate alias to use
# Customize this if you are providing a keystore in instance/config/keystore (for JKS)
# or instance/config/keystore.p12 (for PKCS#12)
# and the server certificate alias is not the default server-cert
# CERTIFICATE_NICKNAME=server-cert

# The encryption passphase to use
# This is critical to allow encryption across replicated server and MUST be provided
ENCRYPTION_PASSWORD_FILE=${ROOT_USER_PASSWORD_FILE}

# whitespace-separated list of the log files to tail on the container's standard output
# This is optional and will default to tailing access log
