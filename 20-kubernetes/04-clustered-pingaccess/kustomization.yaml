# This builds on top of 01-standalone for a clustered-pingaccess: 
# 1. remove the engine port (3000) from the "pingaccess" deployment. 
# 2. create a separate deployment for "pingaccess-engine" (this would be the deployment in which we would scale # replicas)
# 3. use a different profile (via configmap replace) that:
#   - has a PingAccess.mv.db that defines a PingAccess Console Host
#   - can accept a parameter to set CONSOLE/ENGINE mode
# 4. add environment variable to pass CONSOLE/ENGINE mode

# ****NOTE****: if you run this with `kustomize build 04-clustered-pingaccess | kubectl apply  -f -`
# the PingAccess engine will crash a number of times before starting.
# This occurs because the engine tries receiving properties from an admin node that is not ready. 
# To avoid the crashes, you can apply just the admin node first.
